            Why do we keep coming back to the same apps, even without a notification? Nir Eyal's Hooked offers a
            compelling framework for understanding the hidden psychology behind habit-forming products — and what it
            means for designers, marketers, and users alike.

            Think Faster Talk Smarter is a book written by Matt Abrahams, an expert in communication and a Stanford
            University professor, who teaches organizational behaviour. Communication is the lifeline of any
            relationship- be it personal or professional. Interestingly, while our educational system prepares us for
            communication in a formal setting - such as delivering a presentation, writing clear emails, rehearsed
            conversations etc., it doesn’t coach us for speaking in an informal setting...

            Love is an emotion that has always intrigued me. It is loaded with lot of contrarian feelings- you need the
            person you love to be possessive about you yet need your space; you need that person to respect your
            thoughts and let you do things on your course yet you want that person to offer their unsolicited views, and
            I could go on and on about how this universal feeling called "LOVE" is so unfathomable. Perhaps, this is
            why, no matter how many movies are done around the central theme of love, new ones with fresh perspective
            like "Lover" still is celebrated by the audience. </div>

            Vignesh Raja's debut movie Por Thozhil revolves around the story where 2 cops are on a mission to hunt down
            a serial killer. This is a stereotypical theme, which Kollywood audience are used to from the days of
            Sigappu Rojakkal but the director has navigated through the plot with rich twists and tight screenplay,
            maintaining the suspense all through the movie. </div>

            'Woman+ Unmarried+ Approaching one's 30s' is a perfect combination that would invite unabated sympathies and
            advise from one's friends(married) and family. Archana 31 Not Out portrays the life of one such woman,
            Archana(played by Aishwarya Lekshmi), who struggles to find the right groom for her. And when she eventually
            thinks she has found one, a twist awaits her. </div>

            None likes facing crisis in life but we all know that it is inevitable though it's form and severity may
            vary. Some crisis could impact self while some like Covid 19 could impact people at large. Darwin's theory
            of evolution talks about survival of the fittest, which emphasizes on the adaptablity to the adverse
            situations as a quintessential quality to live to see another day. This theory is very much and all the more
            relevant in present scenario given the VUCA (volatile, uncertain, complex and ambiguous) nature of the
            world. But what are the essential qualities, you may wonder. Thanks to the authors T N Hari and Sanjay

            The movie's storyline is very straight forward: How travel can change one's outlook about life. Of late, in
            Kollywood cinema, this pattern can be seen where there is a depressed person(men, mostly) who would climb on
            their Royal Enfield bike and then set off to the Himalayan mountains; when they return, they become a
            refined soul. So, is this movie any different from the stereotypical portrayal?! Ah, you can't get to the
            verdict right in the first paragraph :D </div>
